## Core outcomes

- Safe citizen development without shadow IT
- Controlled data movement between services
- Reliable ALM and environment strategy

## Governance model

### Environment strategy

Define environment tiers (Dev/Test/Prod), owners, and default DLP boundaries.

### DLP and connectors

Use connector groups to prevent unsafe data mixing and enforce business boundaries.

### ALM discipline

Solutions, pipelines, and managed environments keep deployments predictable.
