## Introduction

Modern cloud infrastructure requires careful planning, robust automation, and adherence to best practices. In this article, I'll share insights from building production-grade infrastructure on Microsoft Azure using Terraform as our Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.

## Why Azure and Terraform?

Azure provides a comprehensive suite of cloud services, while Terraform offers a declarative approach to infrastructure management. Together, they enable:

- **Reproducibility**: Infrastructure defined as code can be version-controlled and replicated across environments
- **Scalability**: Resources scale dynamically based on demand
- **Cost Optimization**: Fine-grained control over resource provisioning
- **Multi-cloud Flexibility**: Terraform supports multiple cloud providers

## Key Architecture Patterns

### 1. Hub-and-Spoke Network Topology

```hcl
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "hub" {
  name                = "hub-vnet"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.networking.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.networking.location
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "firewall" {
  name                 = "AzureFirewallSubnet"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.networking.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.hub.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
}
```

### 2. Zero Trust Security Model

Implementing zero trust principles ensures that every request is authenticated and authorized:

- Network segmentation with NSGs
- Just-in-time VM access
- Azure AD integration
- Private endpoints for PaaS services

## Best Practices

1. **State Management**: Use remote backends (Azure Storage) for Terraform state
2. **Module Design**: Create reusable modules for common patterns
3. **Security**: Store secrets in Azure Key Vault, never in code
4. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging with Azure Monitor
5. **Cost Management**: Use tags for cost allocation and set budgets

## Conclusion

Building scalable cloud infrastructure requires a combination of solid architecture, automation, and operational excellence. Azure and Terraform provide the tools needed to achieve these goals efficiently.
