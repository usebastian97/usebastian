## Security and Compliance Concepts

### 1. The Shared Responsibility Model

<Callout type="info" title="Core Principle">
Security responsibilities are divided between Azure (cloud provider) and the customer based on service model.
</Callout>

| Service Model | Customer Responsibility | Azure Responsibility |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **IaaS** | OS, applications, data, network config | Physical infrastructure, hypervisor |
| **PaaS** | Applications, data | OS, runtime, infrastructure |
| **SaaS** | User management, data governance | Everything from infrastructure to application |

<Card title="📌 Key Takeaways" variant="highlight">

- Azure handles physical security, network infrastructure, and platform maintenance
- Customers manage identity, data encryption, access control, and application security
- Responsibility increases as you move from SaaS → PaaS → IaaS

</Card>

<Callout type="tip" title="Real-World Analogy">
Like renting an apartment—the landlord maintains the building structure, but you secure your belongings and lock your doors.
</Callout>

---

### 3. Zero Trust Model

<Callout type="warning" title="Guiding Principle">
"Never trust, always verify" — assume breach and verify every request.
</Callout>

<Card title="🔐 Three Foundational Pillars" variant="gradient">

**1. Verify Explicitly**  
Always authenticate using all available data points (identity, device, location, risk)

**2. Least Privilege Access**  
Grant minimal necessary permissions with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough Access

**3. Assume Breach**  
Minimize blast radius, segment access, verify end-to-end encryption

</Card>

#### Six Zero Trust Pillars

| Pillar | Security Controls |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Identity** | Azure AD, MFA, Conditional Access |
| **Devices** | Intune compliance, device health checks |
| **Applications** | App proxy, Cloud App Security |
| **Data** | Sensitivity labels, encryption, DLP |
| **Network** | Microsegmentation, Private Link |
| **Infrastructure** | Just-In-Time VM access, Defender for Cloud |

<Card title="🔄 Access Flow" variant="highlight">

<Steps>
<Step number={1}>
User/device initiates access
</Step>
<Step number={2}>
Identity verified (MFA)
</Step>
<Step number={3}>
Device compliance checked
</Step>
<Step number={4}>
Risk evaluated contextually
</Step>
<Step number={5}>
Access granted/denied/challenged
</Step>
<Step number={6}>
Continuous monitoring during session
</Step>
</Steps>

</Card>

### 4. Encryption and Hashing

#### Encryption

**Purpose:** Protect data confidentiality through reversible transformation.

**Types:**
- **Symmetric:** Single key for encryption/decryption (AES-256) — fast, used for data at rest
- **Asymmetric:** Public/private key pairs (RSA) — secure key exchange, TLS/SSL
- **Hybrid:** Combines both for optimal security and performance

**Azure Implementation:**
- **At Rest:** Azure Storage Service Encryption, SQL TDE, Disk Encryption
- **In Transit:** TLS 1.2+, HTTPS, VPN encryption
- **Key Management:** Azure Key Vault for centralized control

#### Hashing

**Purpose:** Ensure data integrity through irreversible transformation.

**Characteristics:**
- Fixed-length output regardless of input size
- One-way function (cannot reverse to original)
- Collision-resistant (different inputs produce different hashes)

**Common Uses:**
- Password storage (with salt)
- File integrity verification
- Digital signatures
- Blockchain validation

**Algorithms:** SHA-256, SHA-512, bcrypt (for passwords)

<Callout type="warning" title="Critical Distinction">

**Encryption = Confidentiality** (use when you need to read data later)  
**Hashing = Integrity** (use when you only need verification)

</Callout>

---

### 5. Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)

**Framework Purpose:** Align cloud operations with business objectives, manage risks, and meet regulatory requirements.

#### Three Pillars

**Governance**
- Defines rules, roles, and policies
- Tools: Azure Policy, Management Groups, Blueprints
- Enforces resource standards and accountability

**Risk Management**
- Identifies and mitigates security threats
- Tools: Defender for Cloud, Secure Score
- Continuous assessment of security posture

**Compliance**
- Ensures adherence to regulations
- Tools: Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager
- Frameworks: ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2

#### Implementation Hierarchy

<CodeBlock title="Azure Governance Hierarchy" lang="text">
Management Groups (organization-wide policies)
        ↓
Subscriptions (cost and resource boundaries)
        ↓
Resource Groups (logical grouping)
        ↓
Resources (individual services)
</CodeBlock>

<Card title="✅ Best Practices" variant="highlight">

- Establish management group hierarchy early
- Implement Azure Policy at the highest appropriate level
- Use Blueprints for repeatable compliant deployments
- Monitor continuously with Defender for Cloud
- Regular compliance reporting through Purview

</Card>

## Identity Concepts

### 6. Identity as the Primary Security Perimeter

**Paradigm Shift:** Traditional network perimeters no longer suffice—identity is the new security boundary.

**Why This Matters:**
- Users access resources from anywhere (remote work, mobile, cloud)
- Network location is no longer trustworthy
- Identity verification happens continuously, not just at login

**Scope of Identity:**
- **Human identities:** Employees, contractors, partners
- **Non-human identities:** Applications, services, devices, IoT

**Microsoft Entra ID Role:**
- Central identity provider
- Enforces Conditional Access policies
- Monitors risk signals through Identity Protection
- Manages privileged access via PIM

**Control Mechanisms:**
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Conditional Access (context-based decisions)
- Continuous verification (session monitoring)
- Risk-based adaptive authentication

---

### 7. Authentication

**Definition:** Verifying the identity of a user, device, or service before granting access.

#### Authentication Factors

1. **Something You Know:** Password, PIN, security question
2. **Something You Have:** Hardware token, phone, smart card
3. **Something You Are:** Biometric (fingerprint, face, iris)

#### Authentication Types

| Type | Description | Security Level |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **Single-Factor (SFA)** | Password only | Low |
| **Multi-Factor (MFA)** | Password + token/biometric | High |
| **Passwordless** | FIDO2 keys, Windows Hello | Highest |
| **Certificate-Based** | Digital certificates | High (for devices) |

**Modern Authentication Features:**
- Risk-based challenges (adaptive MFA)
- Device compliance checks
- Location and network evaluation
- Impossible travel detection

<Card title="🔐 Azure AD Authentication Flow" variant="gradient">

<Steps>
<Step number={1}>
User presents identifier (username)
</Step>
<Step number={2}>
Credentials submitted (password + MFA)
</Step>
<Step number={3}>
Azure AD validates credentials
</Step>
<Step number={4}>
Risk evaluation performed
</Step>
<Step number={5}>
Token issued upon success
</Step>
<Step number={6}>
Session monitored continuously
</Step>
</Steps>

</Card>

<Callout type="info" title="Critical Distinction">
Authentication answers "Who are you?" before authorization asks "What can you do?"
</Callout>

---

### 8. Authorization

**Definition:** Determining what an authenticated identity can access and which actions they can perform.

#### Authorization Models

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Assign roles to users
- Roles contain permission sets
- Best for managing many users with similar needs

**Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
- Policies based on attributes (user, resource, environment)
- Fine-grained control
- Context-aware decisions (time, location, device)

**Policy-Based Access Control**
- Centralized policy engine
- Dynamic evaluation
- Scales to complex scenarios

#### Azure Implementation

**Built-in Roles:**
- Owner (full control)
- Contributor (manage resources, not permissions)
- Reader (view only)
- Custom roles (specific needs)

**Scope Levels:**

<CodeBlock title="RBAC Scope Hierarchy" lang="text">
Management Group
      ↓
Subscription
      ↓
Resource Group
      ↓
Individual Resource
</CodeBlock>

<Callout type="warning" title="Least Privilege Principle">
Grant minimum necessary permissions, use Just-In-Time access for privileged operations.
</Callout>

<Card title="🔑 Authorization Flow" variant="gradient">

<Steps>
<Step number={1}>
Authentication completes successfully
</Step>
<Step number={2}>
User requests resource access
</Step>
<Step number={3}>
Azure RBAC evaluates roles and policies
</Step>
<Step number={4}>
Conditional Access applies context rules
</Step>
<Step number={5}>
Decision rendered (grant/deny)
</Step>
<Step number={6}>
Action logged for audit
</Step>
</Steps>

</Card>

### 9. Identity Providers (IdP)

**Definition:** System that creates, maintains, and manages identity information while providing authentication services.

#### Identity Provider Functions

- **Authentication:** Verify user credentials
- **Token Issuance:** Provide secure tokens (SAML, JWT)
- **Federation Support:** Enable trust with external IdPs
- **Single Sign-On:** One login for multiple applications
- **Directory Services:** Store and manage identity objects

#### Microsoft Entra ID as IdP

**For Workforce:**
- Employee authentication
- Device management integration
- Conditional Access enforcement
- Privileged Identity Management

**For Customers (B2C):**
- Social identity providers (Google, Facebook)
- Custom branding
- Self-service sign-up
- User journey customization

**Federation Protocols:**
- **SAML 2.0:** Enterprise federation standard
- **OAuth 2.0:** Authorization framework
- **OpenID Connect:** Modern authentication layer
- **WS-Federation:** Windows-based federation

**IdP Integration Scenarios:**
- Hybrid identity (on-premises AD + Azure AD)
- Partner B2B collaboration
- Customer-facing applications
- SaaS application SSO

---

### 10. Directory Services and Active Directory

**Directory Service Definition:** Hierarchical database storing and organizing network resources (users, computers, permissions).

#### Core Functions

1. **Authentication:** Verify entity identity
2. **Authorization:** Define access rights
3. **Policy Enforcement:** Apply consistent configurations
4. **Resource Discovery:** Locate network resources

#### LDAP Protocol

**Lightweight Directory Access Protocol** defines how clients query and modify directory data in tree structures.

**Directory Information Tree (DIT):**

<CodeBlock title="LDAP Directory Structure" lang="ldif">
dc=company,dc=com (root)
        ↓
    ou=Users
        ↓
    cn=John Doe
</CodeBlock>

#### Active Directory Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Domain** | Logical group of objects under single administration |
| **Domain Controller** | Server hosting AD database and authentication |
| **Forest** | Collection of domains sharing schema and trust |
| **Organizational Unit** | Container for grouping and managing objects |
| **Group Policy** | Configuration rules applied to users/computers |

#### Evolution to Cloud

**On-Premises AD:**
- Kerberos authentication
- Group Policy management
- LDAP queries
- Domain-joined devices

**Azure AD (Microsoft Entra ID):**
- Cloud-native identity
- Modern protocols (OAuth, OIDC)
- App-based authentication
- Device compliance (not domain join)
- Conditional Access (not Group Policy)

**Hybrid Scenarios:**
- Azure AD Connect synchronization
- Pass-through authentication
- Password hash sync
- Seamless SSO

---

### 11. Federation

**Definition:** Linking identity systems to enable cross-organizational access without duplicate accounts.

#### Federation Components

**Identity Provider (IdP):** Authenticates users and issues tokens
**Service Provider (SP):** Trusts IdP tokens and grants access
**Federation Trust:** Formal agreement enabling shared authentication
**Tokens:** Encrypted credentials (SAML/JWT) confirming identity

#### How Federation Works

<Card title="🔄 Federation Flow" variant="gradient">

<Steps>
<Step number={1}>
User accesses application (SP)
</Step>
<Step number={2}>
SP redirects to home IdP
</Step>
<Step number={3}>
IdP authenticates user
</Step>
<Step number={4}>
IdP issues security token
</Step>
<Step number={5}>
Token sent to SP
</Step>
<Step number={6}>
SP validates token
</Step>
<Step number={7}>
Access granted based on claims
</Step>
</Steps>

</Card>

#### Federation vs. Synchronization

**Federation:**
- Delegates authentication to original IdP
- Real-time verification
- No password duplication
- Users managed in home system

**Synchronization:**
- Copies identity data to Azure AD
- Local authentication possible
- Duplicate user objects
- Requires sync agent

#### Federation Use Cases

| Scenario | Implementation |
|----------|---------------|
| **Hybrid Identity** | AD FS federates with Azure AD |
| **B2B Collaboration** | Partner IdP trusted by Azure AD |
| **B2C Customer Access** | Social IdP integration (Google, Facebook) |
| **SaaS Integration** | SAML federation with Salesforce, ServiceNow |

**Supported Protocols:**
- SAML 2.0 (traditional enterprise)
- WS-Federation (Windows environments)
- OpenID Connect (modern applications)
