## Why these assets exist

Most governance programs stall because teams move straight to tooling without a shared operating model. These assets are meant to be reused in workshops, architecture reviews, and implementation sprints.

They are intentionally lightweight so teams can adapt them quickly.

## Linkable assets (frameworks, checklists, templates)

### 1) Microsoft 365 Governance Framework (one‑page overview)

A concise model that defines the *what*, *who*, and *how* across identity, data protection, and collaboration controls.

- Use when aligning security, IT, and business owners
- Works as a blueprint for quarterly governance reviews

### 2) Security & Compliance Baseline Checklist

A practical checklist you can run every time a tenant or workload is updated.

- Identity: MFA, Conditional Access, role segmentation
- Data: sensitivity labels, DLP, retention, eDiscovery
- Devices: compliant devices, managed endpoints, posture

### 3) Copilot Data Boundary Readiness Matrix

A structured way to assess where Copilot can be safely enabled.

- Permissions and data exposure risk by department
- High‑risk data sources identified early
- Prioritized cleanup tasks before rollout

### 4) Change Management Template for M365 Rollouts

A simple rollout template to keep adoption and governance aligned.

- Stakeholders, timeline, and comms plan
- Security validation gates
- Post‑launch measurement checklist
