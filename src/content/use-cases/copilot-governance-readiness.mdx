title: 'Copilot Governance Readiness for Legal, HR & Finance'
description: 'Built a readiness framework to enable Copilot safely across legal, finance, and HR with data boundary checks, labeling, and policy controls.'
category: 'copilot-governance'
problem: 'Leaders wanted Copilot quickly, but sensitive data lived in SharePoint and Teams with inconsistent permissions and labeling, creating high exposure risk.'
solution: 'Created a readiness program that inventoried data sources, standardized sensitivity labels, enforced DLP and retention policies, and mapped acceptable Copilot use by department.'
result: 'Enabled phased Copilot rollout with clear guardrails, reduced exposure of sensitive files, and created a reusable governance template for future departments.'
technologies:
  - Microsoft 365 Copilot
  - Microsoft Purview
  - Sensitivity Labels
  - DLP
  - SharePoint Online

## The Challenge

Copilot adoption was moving faster than governance. Sensitive legal and HR data lived in sites and Teams with inconsistent permissions and labeling. The risk was accidental exposure, not malicious intent.

## What I Built

A Copilot governance readiness framework that aligns people, data, and policy before enabling Copilot at scale.

## Implementation Highlights

- **Data boundary review**: identified high‑risk locations and owners
- **Labeling baseline**: standardized sensitivity labels and defaults
- **DLP guardrails**: blocked sharing of sensitive classes across external boundaries
- **Department rollout gates**: required minimum controls before activation
- **Comms + training**: defined “safe prompts” and “unsafe behaviors”

## Outcome

Copilot was enabled in controlled waves, starting with lower‑risk groups. The readiness framework became a template for future departments, reducing rollout time and security risk.

## Assets Delivered

- Copilot readiness checklist by department
- Data boundary review template
- Labeling and DLP rollout plan
