Rather than relying on a solitary control, this strategy assumes that any single defense can fail. Azure provides a robust constellation of services engineered to implement this paradigm at scale.\n\nThe principle originates from military doctrine. Successive barriers slow a"

The main threat was accidental data exposure through public access or long-lived SAS t"
